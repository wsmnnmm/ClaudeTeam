"""Single console-scripts entry point for the `claudeteam` command.

Subcommands are registered in COMMANDS as `name → handler(argv)` pairs.  Each
handler returns an int exit code or None (treated as 0).  This module owns
the top-level dispatch, usage text, and process exit; subcommand modules
own their own argv parsing and side effects.
