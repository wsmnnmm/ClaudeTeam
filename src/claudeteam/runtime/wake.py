Two ways an agent's pane can be in a state that's not yet ready to
receive a message:

1. Boss configured the agent as `lazy` in team.json — `claudeteam start`
   created the window but didn't spawn the CLI.  The pane is just a

2. The CLI exited — Ctrl-C, /clear, OOM, network blip — and the watchdog
   either hasn't noticed yet or doesn't supervise this pane.

Either way, the next time deliver.apply() wants to inject, it should
detect "no CLI ready" and bring it up.  This module is the detection +
spawn step, kept pure-ish (collaborators injectable for tests).
