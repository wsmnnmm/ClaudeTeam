"""Layer A — automated, CI-runnable proof that a long-running task's verbatim
intent survives context compaction (the /compact anti-drift guarantee).

WHAT THIS LAYER PROVES (and what it deliberately doesn't)
--------------------------------------------------------
A real `/compact` is a Claude Code runtime behaviour we can't invoke in-process.
What we CAN prove deterministically is the *substrate* that makes compaction
survivable: after compaction the only context that remains is (1) the agent's
always-loaded native `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (re-read every turn, never part of
the compacted transcript) and (2) the immutable intent store (`task intent
get`). This harness models "the conversation/init-prompt got compacted away"
by re-deriving the agent's loaded context *purely from those two durable
channels* — exactly what Claude Code re-reads on the first post-compaction turn
— and asserting the boss's verbatim ask is still byte-identical.

It canNOT prove the real model re-ingests the file; that is Layer B (container,
real Claude Code, real `/compact` + `/clear`), run by qa — steps in
`.claudeteam/agents/dev/proposal-compaction-survival-test.md`.

OBJECTIVE JUDGES (all byte-exact on a canary nonce, no subjective "do you
remember?"):
    A  承重墙在位   — harness reads the on-disk CLAUDE.md, asserts it carries
                      the verbatim raw_text incl. the nonce + the drop-prone
                      hard constraint.
    B  store 现读   — `tasks.get_intent` returns the raw_text byte-identical
                      after heavy task-field drift (the immutable ground truth).
    C  正确 task 态 — the active intent-task is recovered (not a stale/completed
                      sibling), via the task store.
NEGATIVE CONTROLS (prove the assertions can actually fail → they discriminate):
    - anchor-off: a non-active task does NOT leak its ask into the durable file.
    - done-drop : once the task completes, its now-stale ask vanishes from the
                  durable file (freshness — directly exercises the on-disk
                  refresh wiring).

Pure store + CLI + on-disk projection; no tmux / Feishu / real model.
